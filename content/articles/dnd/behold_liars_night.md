*"Ah yes. Well! Adventurers! Adventures are here, here at my very own home. And on Liar's Night, of all nights! Did you think I would not have expected you? Did you think I did not prepare for this? Do you believe, as you may, that I have crawled inside this carved gourd because I had let my guard down? Ha! Ha. Haaaa. You see, this is all happening exactly as I have planned it. You never had a chance!*

*Wait? What's that? Candy... for Liar's Night? Oh! I see. Yes, yes... of course. You are here, for the candy. Well! Behold the Beholder, it should not be said, is not prepared for such things. I have gnomish chocolate gum-drops for each of you. Do not ask about the gnomes. Do not. Take these chocolates, take them! And beware, there are many dangers out here tonight. Strange creatures prowl the town, dread curses sweep over the land, there is murder in the streets, and even the festivities have an air of danger to them! Be careful, small ones, for it is Liars' Night.*

*And mischief loves a good adventure."*

*--Behold, the beholder*
