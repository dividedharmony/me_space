*The 12 Days of Midwinter* is a collection of Dungeons & Dragons adventures inspired by the mythology, traditions, and lore of the Winter season. This collection features ~200 pages of adventures designed for every Tier of play, for characters between levels 1 and 20.

Each of the twelve adventures is a setting-agnostic one-shot, which can be run as a stand-alone adventure or dropped into a preexisting campaign. The adventures in this anthology are not related to one another but, with a bit of ingenuity and DM-discretion, could be combined into a festively epic campaign.

- The Unveiling (A Dark Fiend in a Rare Shield), by Josh Parry
- Misfits (Two Teddy Terrors), by Dr. Kelly Lane
- The Burgomaster's Gift (Three Ales Too Many), by Adam Scaramella
