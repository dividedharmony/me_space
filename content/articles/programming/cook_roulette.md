This web application uses the [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) web framework and uses [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activerecord) to interface with a [SQLite Database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

The `cook_roulette` app works by having the user submit a URL to to an [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/) recipe. Using [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/), `cook_roulette` scraps the recipe to find the ingredient list and save it to the app's database. 

Then the user can identify common ingredients across multiple recipes. For example, one recipe can call for "2 cups of shredded carrots" and another recipe can call for "3 Carrots (chopped)", but the common ingredient is "Carrots".

The user can then get a meal plan that is generated by randomly picking recipes submitted by the user. The meal plan comes with a grocery list which is grouped by common ingredients.
