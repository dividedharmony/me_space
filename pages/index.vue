        David Harmon [he/him] is a writer and fullstack developer born and bred
        in the rolling hills of North Carolina. His hobbies include painting
        way-too-many-miniatures, sketching maps, and tending his succulents and
        indoor herb garden. He enjoys reading manga and popular physics books,
        sipping coffee, and taking a good nap. His bad-habits include buying
        more books than he has time to read, more games than he has time to
        play, and more snacks than he can eat. He enjoys pouring his lifeblood
        into Dark Souls, then recuperating with Cookie Clicker and the
        peaceful-mode of Minecraft. He dabbles in digital-based artwork and the
        endless depths of Magic: The Gathering. You can follow his escapades on
